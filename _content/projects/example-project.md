# Example Project

This is a fake project made for testing purposes. But look at **all** _this_ `sweet` [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)!

What!? I find your lack of faith disturbing. What!? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

* I'm trying not to, kid.
* As you wish.
* A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. What!? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You mean it controls your actions? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
